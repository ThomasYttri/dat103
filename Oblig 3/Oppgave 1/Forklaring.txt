Forklaring på opsjoner: 

-f ; 		Format, specifies the output file format, to be using the elf 
		file.
		


-F ;		Specifies the debug information format, to be using the dwarf
		assembler.

-g ;		Causes nasm to generate debug information, for the file
		hello.asm.

ld ;		The command combines a number of objects and archive files, 
		relocates their data and ties up symbol references. The last
		step before compiling a program is usually to run ld.

ld -m ;		Emulate the emulation linker. 
		

elf_i386 ; 	ELF for i386 - 32-bit i386 binaries

ld -o ;		Use output as the name for the proram produced by ld; if this
		option is not specified, the name a.out is used by default.

elf ;		An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an
		Elf header, followed by a program header table or a section
		header table, or both. The ELF header is always at offset 
		zero of the file. The program header table and the section 
		header table's offset in the file are defined in the ELF header.
		The two tables describe the rest of the particularities of
		the file.
		
		This header file describes the above mentioned headers as
		C structures and also includes structures for dynamic sections,
		relocation sections and symbol tables.

dwarf ;		Is a debugging format for ELF files. Created to overcome 
		shortcomings in STAB, allowing for more detailed and compact
		descriptions of data structures, such as in C.
